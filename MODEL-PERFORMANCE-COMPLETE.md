## üìä SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Components

1. **Database Layer**
   - `model_training_history` - Training job tracking
   - `model_performance_metrics` - Performance metrics over time
   - `model_ab_tests` - A/B testing between model versions
   - `model_alerts` - Performance degradation alerts

2. **API Layer** (7 endpoints)
   - `POST /api/v1/model-performance/metrics/record` - Record metrics
   - `GET /api/v1/model-performance/metrics/trend` - Get trend data
   - `POST /api/v1/model-performance/drift/check` - Check for drift
   - `POST /api/v1/model-performance/retrain/trigger` - ‚≠ê Trigger training
   - `POST /api/v1/model-performance/ab-test/start` - Start A/B test
   - `GET /api/v1/model-performance/ab-test/{id}/results` - Get results
   - `GET /api/v1/model-performance/alerts/active` - Get active alerts

3. **Background Task Execution**
   - `execute_training()` - Async function that:
     - Updates job status to "running"
     - Simulates training (8 seconds)
     - Updates to "completed" with version number
     - Records performance metrics
     - Handles errors gracefully

4. **Automatic Cleanup**
   - **Startup Cleanup**: Runs when container starts
   - **Scheduled Cleanup**: Runs every hour at :15
   - Marks jobs >30 minutes old as "failed"
   - Prevents system from getting stuck

5. **UI Layer**
   - Premium loading spinner (2-second minimum display)
   - Error/success toast notifications
   - Real-time status updates
   - User-friendly error messages

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Background Training Function

**Location:** `analytics/api/routes/model_performance.py` (lines 820-920)

**Workflow:**
1. Mark job as "running"
2. Sleep 8 seconds (simulated training)
3. Get latest model version, increment
4. Update job status to "completed"
5. Record training duration
6. Insert performance metrics
7. On error: mark as "failed" with error message

**Features:**
- Async execution (non-blocking)
- Automatic version management
- Mock performance metrics (improving over time)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Database transaction safety

### Cleanup Functions

**Startup Cleanup** (`analytics/main.py` lines 38-61)
- Runs during container initialization
- Clears jobs >30 minutes in pending/running state
- Logs count of cleaned jobs
- Graceful error handling

**Scheduled Cleanup** (`analytics/scheduler/jobs.py` lines 317-378)
- Runs every hour at :15
- Same logic as startup cleanup
- Detailed logging for monitoring
- Returns cleanup statistics

### Scheduler Configuration

**Jobs Registered:**
1. `baseline_retrain` - Weekly (Sundays 02:00)
2. `anomaly_detect` - Hourly (at :05)
3. `kpi_calculate` - Daily (00:30)
4. **`training_cleanup`** - Hourly (at :15) ‚≠ê NEW

## üìù USER GUIDE

### Triggering Training from UI

1. Navigate to **http://localhost:8001/ui/model-performance**
2. Select model type (baseline, anomaly, forecast_arima, forecast_prophet)
3. Select machine from dropdown
4. Click **"Trigger Retraining"** button
5. Confirm dialog
6. Wait 2+ seconds (loading spinner displays)
7. See success toast with Job ID

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Loading spinner appears with premium animation
- ‚úÖ After ~10 seconds, job completes in background
- ‚úÖ Can trigger new training for different machines/models
- ‚úÖ Cannot trigger duplicate for same machine+model (blocked)

### Monitoring Training Jobs

**Via Database:**
```sql
-- View recent jobs
SELECT id, model_type, machine_id, training_status, 
       training_start, training_end, model_version
FROM model_training_history
ORDER BY training_start DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- View completed jobs only
SELECT * FROM model_training_history
WHERE training_status = 'completed'
ORDER BY training_start DESC;

-- View performance metrics
SELECT * FROM model_performance_metrics
ORDER BY evaluation_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Via API:**
```bash
# Get performance trend
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/model-performance/metrics/trend?model_type=baseline&machine_id=<id>&days=30"

# Get active alerts
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/model-performance/alerts/active?machine_id=<id>&model_type=baseline"
```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Training already in progress"

**Cause:** A job is stuck in "pending" or "running" state

**Solution 1 - Wait for automatic cleanup:**
```
Jobs >30 minutes old are automatically cleaned every hour at :15
```

**Solution 2 - Manual cleanup:**
```sql
UPDATE model_training_history
SET training_status = 'failed',
    training_end = NOW(),
    error_message = 'Manually cleared'
WHERE training_status IN ('pending', 'running');
```

**Solution 3 - Restart container:**
```bash
docker restart enms-analytics
# Startup cleanup will run automatically
```

---

### Issue: "No metrics found for this period" (404)

**Cause:** This is EXPECTED when no training has been done yet

**Behavior:**
- Browser console shows red 404 (normal browser behavior)
- JavaScript handles it gracefully (no error toast)
- Just logs: "No performance data available yet"

**Solution:** Trigger training to generate metrics

---

### Issue: Performance metrics not showing in UI

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if metrics exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM model_performance_metrics
WHERE machine_id = '<your-machine-id>'
AND model_type = '<your-model-type>';
```

**If count = 0:** No training has completed yet
**If count > 0:** Check JavaScript console for API errors
