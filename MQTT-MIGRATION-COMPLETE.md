# 📡 MQTT Migration to Internal Broker - Completion Report

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Migrate from external MQTT broker (89.252.166.188:2010) to internal Mosquitto broker to save resources and improve system efficiency with simulated data.

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Host Mosquitto Configuration** ✅
- Configured existing host Mosquitto service (running as systemd service)
- Created password file with authentication: `/etc/mosquitto/passwd`
- Updated configuration: `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/enms.conf`
- Enabled authentication (disabled anonymous access)
- Service running successfully on `172.18.0.1:1883` (Docker gateway IP)

### 2. **Configuration Updates** ✅

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `.env` - Changed `MQTT_HOST` from `89.252.166.188` to `172.18.0.1`
- ✅ `.env` - Changed `MQTT_PORT` from `2010` to `1883`
- ✅ `simulator/config.py` - Updated default MQTT_HOST to `172.18.0.1`
- ✅ `nodered/settings.js` - Updated default broker to `172.18.0.1`
- ✅ `nodered/data/flows.json` - Updated hardcoded broker references (2 instances)
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Updated default MQTT_HOST environment variable
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Commented out mqtt service definition (using host broker)

### 3. **Service Restarts** ✅
- ✅ Mosquitto service restarted with new configuration
- ✅ Simulator rebuilt and restarted (now connecting to 172.18.0.1:1883)
- ✅ Node-RED restarted (now connecting to 172.18.0.1:1883)

### 4. **Verification Tests** ✅
- ✅ MQTT publish/subscribe tests successful
- ✅ Simulator connected to MQTT broker
- ✅ Node-RED connected to MQTT broker
- ✅ Data flowing through MQTT topics (`factory/#`)
- ✅ Database receiving data (254+ energy readings in last 2 minutes)
- ✅ All tables updating: energy_readings, production_data, environmental_data, machine_status

Host Mosquitto: Accessible via gateway IP
Containers → 172.18.0.1:1883 → Host Mosquitto

### Authentication Configuration
```bash
# Password file created at:
/etc/mosquitto/passwd

# User credentials:
Username: raptorblingx
Password: raptorblingx (hashed in file)

# File permissions:
Owner: mosquitto:mosquitto
Mode: 600 (-rw-------)
```

### Mosquitto Configuration
```conf
# /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/enms.conf
listener 1883
protocol mqtt
allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
log_type error
log_type warning
log_type notice
log_timestamp true
max_connections 1000
max_keepalive 60
```

## 📈 Data Flow Verification

### MQTT Topics Active
```
✅ factory/demo/compressor-1/status
✅ factory/demo/compressor-1/energy
✅ factory/demo/compressor-1/production
✅ factory/demo/compressor-1/environmental
✅ factory/demo/hvac-main/*
✅ factory/demo/conveyor-a/*
✅ factory/demo/hydraulic-pump-1/*
✅ factory/demo/injection-molding-1/*
✅ factory/europe/compressor-1/*
✅ factory/europe/hvac-north/*
```

### Sample Data Flow
```
Simulator → MQTT (172.18.0.1:1883) → Node-RED → PostgreSQL
   ↓
Publishing at intervals:
- Compressor: Every 1 second
- HVAC: Every 10 seconds
- Conveyor: Every 10 seconds
- Hydraulic Pump: Every 30 seconds
- Injection Molding: Every 30 seconds
```

   - More reliable connection
   - No external service downtime risk

3. **Better Security** ✅
   - All traffic stays within local network
   - Authentication enabled on MQTT broker
   - No exposure to external network

4. **Simplified Architecture** ✅
   - Using existing host Mosquitto service
   - No additional Docker container needed
   - Easier to maintain and monitor

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Done

### Issues Encountered and Resolved

1. **Port 1883 Already in Use**
   - **Cause:** Host Mosquitto service already running
   - **Solution:** Used host Mosquitto instead of Docker container

2. **Mosquitto Configuration Errors**
   - **Cause:** Duplicate `log_dest file` directive
   - **Solution:** Removed from `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/enms.conf`

3. **Password File Permissions**
   - **Cause:** Incorrect file ownership
   - **Solution:** `chown mosquitto:mosquitto /etc/mosquitto/passwd`

4. **Node-RED Hardcoded Broker**
   - **Cause:** flows.json had hardcoded "mqtt" hostnames
   - **Solution:** Replaced with `sed` command: `s/"broker": "mqtt"/"broker": "172.18.0.1"/g`

5. **Docker Network Access**
   - **Initial Plan:** Use `mqtt` service name
   - **Final Solution:** Use Docker gateway IP `172.18.0.1` for host access

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Docker Gateway IP
- **Gateway IP:** `172.18.0.1`
- **Network:** `enms-network` (bridge mode)
- This IP is **stable** as long as the Docker network isn't recreated
- If you recreate the network, verify the gateway IP with:
  ```bash
  docker network inspect enms-network -f '{{range .IPAM.Config}}{{.Gateway}}{{end}}'
  ```

### Mosquitto Service
- Running as **systemd service** on host
- Configuration: `/etc/mosquitto/`
- Logs: `/var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log`
- Control:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start mosquitto
  sudo systemctl stop mosquitto
  sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
  sudo systemctl status mosquitto
  ```

### Backup Files Created
- `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf.backup`
- `/home/ubuntu/enms/nodered/data/flows.json.backup`

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If you need to revert to external MQTT broker:

1. **Update .env:**
   ```bash
   MQTT_HOST=89.252.166.188
   MQTT_PORT=2010
   ```

2. **Rebuild simulator:**
   ```bash
   docker compose build simulator
   docker compose up -d simulator
   ```

3. **Restore Node-RED flows:**
   ```bash
   cp /home/ubuntu/enms/nodered/data/flows.json.backup \
