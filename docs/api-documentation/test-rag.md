### Test Questions for RAG Model

**Question 1: Concept Differentiation**
Based on the definitions in Section 3 and the requirements in 4.6.4, explain the fundamental difference between a "correction" and a "corrective action" when addressing a nonconformity in the energy management system.

*   **Expected Answer:** A "correction" is the immediate action taken to eliminate a detected nonconformity (e.g., fixing a leak). In contrast, a "corrective action" is the action taken to eliminate the *cause* of that nonconformity to prevent it from happening again (e.g., implementing a new maintenance schedule to prevent future leaks).
*   **Location in PDF:**
    *   **Page 10, Section 3, Clauses 3.3 and 3.4:** These clauses provide the formal definitions for "correction" and "corrective action."
    *   **Page 20, Clause 4.6.4:** This section outlines the process for handling nonconformities, which includes both making corrections and taking corrective action.

**Question 2: Cross-Referencing and Hierarchical Understanding**
Describe the hierarchical relationship between the "Energy policy" (clause 4.3), "Energy objectives and targets," and "energy management action plans" (clause 4.4.6). How does the policy influence the creation of the action plans?

*   **Expected Answer:** The "Energy policy" is the highest-level document; it states the organization's overall commitment and provides the framework for setting goals. Based on this policy, the organization establishes specific, measurable "Energy objectives and targets." To achieve these objectives, the organization then develops detailed "energy management action plans," which outline the specific responsibilities, means, and time frames for implementation.
*   **Location in PDF:**
    *   **Page 14, Clause 4.3 (e):** States that the energy policy "provides the framework for setting and reviewing energy objectives and targets."
    *   **Page 16, Clause 4.4.6:** Explains that action plans are established for "achieving its objectives and targets."

**Question 3: Input/Output Process Analysis**
According to sections 4.7.2 and 4.7.3, list three mandatory inputs required for a management review, and three mandatory outputs that must result from it.

*   **Expected Answer:**
    *   **Three Inputs:** Any three from the list, for example: (a) follow-up actions from previous management reviews, (b) review of the energy policy, and (c) EnMS audit results.
    *   **Three Outputs:** Any three from the list, for example: (a) changes in the energy performance of the organization, (b) changes to the energy policy, and (c) changes to the EnPIs.
*   **Location in PDF:**
    *   **Page 20, Clause 4.7.2 "Input to management review":** Contains the full list of required inputs.
    *   **Page 21, Clause 4.7.3 "Output from management review":** Contains the full list of required outputs.

**Question 4: Negative Requirement / Scope Limitation**
Does the BS ISO 50001:2011 standard establish absolute, specific energy performance requirements (e.g., a specific kWh limit) that an organization must meet? Explain your answer by referencing the "Scope" (Section 1).

*   **Expected Answer:** No, the standard does not prescribe specific or absolute performance criteria. It requires the organization to achieve continual improvement relative to its own baseline and commitments. The Scope section explicitly states, "This International Standard does not prescribe specific performance criteria with respect to energy."
*   **Location in PDF:**
    *   **Page 9, Section 1 "Scope," third paragraph:** The exact sentence clarifying this limitation is located here.

**Question 5: Scenario-Based Application**
An organization certified to ISO 50001:2011 replaces its main production line with a new, more efficient technology. According to section 4.4.4, what specific action must this organization take regarding its "energy baseline," and why?

*   **Expected Answer:** The organization must make adjustments to its energy baseline. This is required because replacing a main production line constitutes a "major change to the process," which is one of the specific conditions listed in the standard that mandates a baseline adjustment to ensure performance is measured accurately.
*   **Location in PDF:**
    *   **Pages 15-16, Clause 4.4.4 "Energy baseline":** The paragraph starting "Adjustments to the baseline(s) shall be made..." lists the conditions, including "major changes to the process."

**Question 6: Table-Based Reasoning**
Using the correspondence table in Annex B (page 28), identify which clause from ISO 9001:2008 corresponds to clause 4.4.2 "Legal requirements and other requirements" in ISO 50001:2011.

*   **Expected Answer:** Clause 7.2.1 ("Determination of requirements related to the product") in ISO 9001:2008 corresponds to clause 4.4.2 in ISO 50001:2011.
*   **Location in PDF:**
    *   **Page 28, Annex B table:** Locate the row for "ISO 50001:2011" Clause "4.4.2." Follow this row across to the "ISO 9001:2008" column to find the corresponding clause number, "7.2.1."

**Question 7: Detail-Oriented Requirement**
According to section 4.5.7, when an organization procures products or services that can have a significant impact on energy use, what specific information must it convey to its suppliers?

*   **Expected Answer:** The organization must inform its suppliers that "procurement is partly evaluated on the basis of energy performance."
*   **Location in PDF:**
    *   **Page 18, Clause 4.5.7 "Procurement of energy services, products, equipment and energy," first paragraph:** The specific requirement is stated in this paragraph.
