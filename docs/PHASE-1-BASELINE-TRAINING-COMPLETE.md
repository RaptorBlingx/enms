### Baseline Training Results

| SEU | R² Score | Formula | Status |
|-----|----------|---------|--------|
| **Compressor-1** | 0.9871 | Energy = 0.0610 + 0.000043×prod - 0.000004×temp | ✅ Excellent |
| **Compressor-EU-1** | 0.9872 | Energy = 0.0608 + 0.000043×prod - 0.000001×temp | ✅ Excellent |
| **HVAC-Main** | 0.0039 | Energy = -0.0710 + 0.004976×temp | ⚠️ Needs degree-days |
| **HVAC-EU-North** | 0.0003 | Energy = 0.0229 + 0.001235×temp | ⚠️ Needs degree-days |
| **Conveyor-A** | 0.9988 | Energy = 0.0003 + 0.000123×prod - 0.000005×temp | ✅ Excellent |
| **Hydraulic-Pump-1** | 0.9987 | Energy = 0.0001 + 0.000185×prod - 0.000001×temp | ✅ Excellent |
| **Injection-Molding-1** | 0.9976 | Energy = -0.0009 + 0.000340×prod + 0.000014×temp | ✅ Excellent |

**Summary:**
- **Production Equipment:** R² > 0.99 (5/7 SEUs) - EXCELLENT fit
- **HVAC Equipment:** R² < 0.01 (2/7 SEUs) - Expected, needs degree-day normalization
- **Training Data:** 366 days (full 2024), 61,488 hourly records

## 📊 Analysis & Insights

### Why Production Equipment Has Excellent Baselines

**Compressors (R² = 0.987):**
- Strong correlation: More production → More compressed air needed
- Temperature effect: Cold air is denser → easier to compress → less energy
- Coefficient 0.000043 kWh/unit makes physical sense for 55kW compressor

**Conveyor-A (R² = 0.999):**
- Nearly perfect fit: VFD motor load directly proportional to throughput
- Temperature has minimal effect (as expected for motors)
- Coefficient 0.000123 kWh/unit reasonable for 22kW rated motor

**Hydraulic-Pump-1 (R² = 0.999):**
- Cycle-driven: More production cycles → More hydraulic pressure needed
- Oil temperature effect: Viscosity changes with temp
- Coefficient 0.000185 kWh/unit consistent with 45kW pump

**Injection-Molding-1 (R² = 0.998):**
- Cycle-based process: Each unit requires barrel heating + hydraulic injection
- Positive temperature coefficient: Ambient heat reduces heating energy
- Coefficient 0.000340 kWh/unit highest (120kW machine, complex process)

### Why HVAC Baselines Are Poor (And Why This Is Expected)

**Problem:** Raw temperature (avg_temp_c) doesn't capture HVAC energy drivers
- **Winter:** Low temp → HIGH heating energy (not captured by linear temp coefficient)
- **Summer:** High temp → HIGH cooling energy (opposite direction)
- Result: Temperature has U-shaped relationship with energy, not linear

**Solution:** Degree-Days (ISO 50006 Standard)
- **Heating Degree-Days (HDD):** Σ max(0, 18°C - T_daily_avg)
  - Measures "coldness" that requires heating
  - Winter: HDD = 300-500 per month
  - Summer: HDD = 0
- **Cooling Degree-Days (CDD):** Σ max(0, T_daily_avg - 18°C)
  - Measures "hotness" that requires cooling
  - Summer: CDD = 200-400 per month
  - Winter: CDD = 0

**Expected Improvement After Degree-Day Implementation:**
- HVAC R² will increase from 0.004 → 0.80+ (industry standard)
- Formula: Energy = β₀ + β₁×HDD + β₂×CDD
- Both coefficients will be positive (more degree-days = more energy)

## 🔍 Data Verification

### Training Data Quality
```sql
-- Verify 2024 baseline data
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(time)) as unique_days,
    MIN(time) as start,
    MAX(time) as end
FROM energy_readings
WHERE time >= '2024-01-01' AND time < '2025-01-01';

-- Result:
-- records: 61,488
-- unique_days: 366 (full year including Feb 29 leap day)
-- start: 2024-01-01 00:00:00
-- end: 2024-12-31 23:00:00
```

### Baseline Storage
```sql
-- All 7 SEUs have trained baselines
SELECT 
    name,
    baseline_year,
    r_squared,
    feature_columns
FROM seus
WHERE is_active = true
ORDER BY r_squared DESC;

-- Result: 7 rows, all with baseline_year=2024
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Day 1 Continues)

### Immediate (Next 2 Hours)
1. **Implement Degree-Day Calculation Function**
   - Create PostgreSQL function `calculate_degree_days()`
   - Base temperature: 18°C (ASHRAE standard)
   - Returns daily HDD and CDD values

2. **Retrain HVAC Baselines with Degree-Days**
   - HVAC-Main: features = [heating_degree_days, cooling_degree_days]
   - HVAC-EU-North: features = [heating_degree_days, cooling_degree_days]
   - Expected R² > 0.75

3. **Generate Monthly Performance Reports**
   - 7 SEUs × 10 months (Jan-Oct 2025) = 70 reports
   - Calculate actual vs expected, deviation %, compliance status

### Day 2 (Tomorrow)
4. **Calculate CUSUM** - Trend detection across monthly reports
5. **Build Grafana Dashboard** - Auditor-ready visualizations
6. **Generate ISO 50001 Compliance Package** - PDF documents for Mr. Umut
