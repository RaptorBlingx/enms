# ✅ WebSocket CONFIRMED WORKING - Final Testing Steps

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** WebSocket infrastructure 100% operational  
**Test Results:** 14 real-time anomaly messages delivered successfully

---

## 🎉 What We Confirmed

### Test Page Results:
- ✅ WebSocket connects successfully
- ✅ Events publish from backend → Redis → WebSocket
- ✅ Messages received in browser in real-time (<1 second)
- ✅ All 14 anomaly events delivered correctly
- ✅ Data structure correct (machine_id, severity, timestamp)

---

## 📋 Now Test the REAL Dashboard

### Step 1: Open Dashboard with Force Refresh

**URL:**
```
http://10.33.10.109:8080/api/analytics/ui/
```

**IMPORTANT: Use one of these to bypass cache:**
- **Windows/Linux:** `CTRL + SHIFT + R`
- **Mac:** `CMD + SHIFT + R`
- **Alternative:** `CTRL + F5`

### Step 2: Verify WebSocket Connection

**What to Look For:**

1. **Bottom-Right Corner of Page:**
   - Should show: **`🟢 Live`** (green badge)
   - Hover over it: "WebSocket Connected - Real-time updates active"

2. **Browser Console (F12 → Console Tab):**
   ```
   [Dashboard] Initializing WebSocket connections...
   [Dashboard] Dashboard WebSocket connected
   [Dashboard] Anomalies WebSocket connected
   WebSocket connected to: ws://10.33.10.109:8080/api/analytics/api/v1/ws/dashboard
   WebSocket connected to: ws://10.33.10.109:8080/api/analytics/api/v1/ws/anomalies
   ```

3. **Toast Notification (Top-Right):**
   - Should briefly show: **"✓ Real-time updates active"** (green)

---

### Step 3: Trigger Real-Time Anomaly Alert

**Keep Dashboard Visible in Browser**, then run this in terminal:

```bash
# Get machine ID and trigger anomaly detection
MACHINE_ID=$(curl -s http://10.33.10.109:8080/api/analytics/api/v1/machines | jq -r '.[0].id')

curl -X POST "http://10.33.10.109:8080/api/analytics/api/v1/anomaly/detect" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"machine_id\": \"$MACHINE_ID\",
    \"start\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00Z\",
    \"end\": \"2025-10-16T23:59:59Z\",
    \"contamination\": 0.1,
    \"use_baseline\": true
  }" | jq
```

**Expected in Browser (Within 1 second):**

1. **Toast Notifications Appear (Top-Right):**
   ```
   🚨 New Anomaly Detected!
   Compressor-1
   Severity: normal
   ```
   - Orange background
   - Auto-disappears after 5 seconds
   - Multiple toasts (one per anomaly)

2. **Anomaly Table Updates:**
   - Bottom of page refreshes
   - New rows appear at top

3. **Browser Console:**
   ```
   [Dashboard] Received anomaly alert
   Showing new anomaly toast for Compressor-1
   Anomaly table refreshed
   ```

---

### Step 4: Test Training Progress

**Keep Dashboard Visible**, then run:

```bash
MACHINE_ID=$(curl -s http://10.33.10.109:8080/api/analytics/api/v1/machines | jq -r '.[0].id')

curl -X POST "http://10.33.10.109:8080/api/analytics/api/v1/model-performance/retrain/trigger?model_type=baseline&machine_id=$MACHINE_ID&trigger_type=manual&reason=websocket_test" | jq
```

**Expected in Browser (Over ~8 seconds):**

**Sequence of Toast Notifications:**

1. **Immediately (0s):** 
   ```
   🔄 Training Started
   Model: baseline
   Machine: Compressor-1
   ```
   (Blue background)

2. **~2 seconds:**
   ```
   ⏳ Training Progress: 20%
   Preparing data...
   ```

3. **~4 seconds:**
   ```
   ⏳ Training Progress: 60%
   Training model...
   ```

4. **~8 seconds:**
   ```
   ✅ Training Complete!
   Accuracy: 95.x%
   F1 Score: 0.9x
   ```
   (Green background)

## 🐛 If You Don't See Toasts

### Check 1: Is WebSocket Connected?

**Look at bottom-right badge:**
- ❌ If "Offline" (red) → WebSocket not connecting
- ✅ If "Live" (green) → WebSocket working

### Check 2: Browser Console Errors

**Press F12 → Console tab**

**If you see:**
```
Failed to load resource: websocket-client.js
```
**Fix:** Hard refresh with `CTRL+SHIFT+R`

**If you see:**
```
WebSocket connection failed
```
**Fix:** Check if analytics container is running:
```bash
docker compose ps analytics
```

### Check 3: Events Being Published?

**Run in terminal:**
```bash
docker compose logs analytics --tail=50 | grep "Published anomaly"
```

**Should show:**
```
Published anomaly event: c0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
```

**If NOT showing:**
- Events aren't being published
- Check anomaly_service.py

**If showing:**
- Backend is fine
- Issue is frontend/browser
