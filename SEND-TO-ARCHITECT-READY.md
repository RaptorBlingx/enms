# üì§ READY TO SEND TO ARCHITECT

**Document:** `PHASE-03-CLARIFICATION-FOR-ARCHITECT.md`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **REVIEWED & APPROVED**  
**Date:** October 11, 2025

## ‚úÖ REVIEW COMPLETE

### Critical Fix Applied
**Fixed:** Database evidence section incorrectly stated 15-minute aggregates exist.  
**Verified:** Only 1-minute aggregates actually exist in the database.  
**Impact:** This correction makes the cascading failure complete and more severe.

### Document Quality
- ‚úÖ **846 lines** of comprehensive analysis
- ‚úÖ **12 major sections** logically organized
- ‚úÖ **10+ specific questions** for architect
- ‚úÖ **15+ code examples** with line numbers
- ‚úÖ **8+ verification results** with evidence
- ‚úÖ **3 solution options** fully detailed
- ‚úÖ **TL;DR added** for quick understanding

- Original schema design fundamentally flawed
- 3 potential solutions with pros/cons

### 6. Specific Requests
- 10 categorized questions requiring decisions
- Database schema guidance needed
- ML model feature recommendations
- Performance impact assessment
- Next steps clarification

## üéØ KEY QUESTIONS FOR ARCHITECT

### Most Critical
1. **Was the TimescaleDB limitation known during design?**
   - If YES: Why was it designed this way?
   - If NO: How should we fix it?

2. **Which aggregation strategy should we use?**
   - Option 1: All aggregates from hypertables (simple but resource-heavy)
   - Option 2: Regular materialized views for higher levels (complex but efficient)
   - Option 3: Keep only 1-minute aggregates (current workaround)

3. **Is 1-minute data acceptable for ML training?**
   - Performance implications?
   - Data quality concerns?
   - Scalability issues?

### Important
4. What features should be in the baseline model to improve R¬≤?
5. What R¬≤ threshold is actually acceptable for production?
6. Should different machine types use different models?

## üí° OPTIONAL ADDITIONS (If Time Permits)

### Nice to Have (Not Required)
1. **Visual diagram** of aggregate hierarchy failure
2. **Performance comparison table** (1-min vs 1-hour queries)
3. **Timeline** of issue discovery
4. **Checklist** of architect decisions needed

### But Not Necessary Because:
- Document is already comprehensive
- All critical information included
- Architect has everything needed
- Adding more might overwhelm
