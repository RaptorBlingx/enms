- ✅ **Chart.js Visualizations** - Displaying real data (no more NaN)
- ✅ **Baseline Training** - Works via UI with driver validation
- ✅ **Anomaly Detection** - Displays anomalies correctly
- ✅ **KPI Calculations** - Shows SEC, Peak Demand, Load Factor, Costs, Carbon
- ✅ **Background Scheduler** - 3 jobs running (baseline retrain, anomaly detect, KPI calculate)
- ✅ **API Endpoints** - All verified and returning correct data
- ✅ **Navigation** - All links working correctly

## 🔧 Issues We Fixed

1. **API Path Issue** - Dashboard showing 9982 → Fixed API_BASE path
2. **Navigation URLs** - 404 errors → Hardcoded full paths
3. **Baseline Training** - 400 error → Fixed driver column names
4. **Anomaly Page** - forEach error → Fixed nested API response handling

## 🚀 Phase 4 - Ready to Start

### Priority 1: Portal Integration (Your Input Needed)
**Question for Architect:**
- How should we integrate analytics into the unified portal?
- Should we use iframe embed or create portal pages?
- Do you need SSO/session sharing between services?
- What's the portal's color scheme/theme?

### Priority 2: Advanced Features
- ARIMA/Prophet forecasting models
- Model performance tracking
- Advanced visualizations (Sankey diagrams, heatmaps)
- Real-time WebSocket updates

### Excluded (Per Developer Request)
- Production hardening (authentication, rate limiting)
- Can be added later if needed
