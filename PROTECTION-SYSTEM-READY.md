## 🔍 How to Know If You're Under Attack

### Scenario 1: Burak's OVOS Making Too Many Requests

**Symptoms:**
```bash
./monitoring/check-system-health.sh

# You'll see:
📊 Request Statistics (Last 1000 log lines):
Total HTTP Requests: 1247
Successful (200): 856
Errors (4xx/5xx): 391  ← High error rate!
Success Rate: 68.6%   ← Should be > 95%

🔥 Top 10 Most Requested Endpoints:
    512 "GET /api/v1/ovos/summary HTTP/1.1"     ← One endpoint dominating
    298 "GET /api/v1/ovos/forecast/tomorrow HTTP/1.1"
```

**What's Happening:**
- OVOS is hitting rate limit (100 req/min)
- Getting 429 errors back
- Need to either:
  - Ask Burak to reduce request frequency
  - Whitelist his IP address
  - Implement request caching

### Scenario 2: DDoS Attack

**Symptoms:**
```bash
./monitoring/monitor-request-rate.sh 60

# You'll see:
⚠️  ALERT: High request rate detected: 523.4 requests/minute
(Threshold: 100 requests/minute)

📊 Top 10 Endpoints (Last 60 seconds):
    412 /api/v1/health                    ← Unusual pattern
    85 /api/v1/machines
    26 /api/v1/anomaly/recent

👥 Top 5 Client IPs:
    498 requests from 203.0.113.45        ← Single IP attacking!
    12 requests from 192.168.1.100
    8 requests from 192.168.1.101
```

**What's Happening:**
- Single IP making excessive requests
- Nginx and application blocking most
- Some getting through due to burst buffer
- Need to block IP at firewall level

### Scenario 3: System Crash/Overload

**Symptoms:**
```bash
./monitoring/check-system-health.sh

# You'll see:
🏥 Container Health:
-------------------------------------------
❌ enms-analytics is DOWN               ← Service crashed!

💻 Resource Usage:
-------------------------------------------
enms-analytics       98.5%     3.89GiB / 4GiB  ← Out of memory!
```

**What's Happening:**
- Too many concurrent requests overwhelmed service
- Protection layers blocked most, but some got through
- Need to restart service and investigate

## 🛠️ Quick Fix Scenarios

### Fix 1: Whitelist Burak's OVOS IP

If OVOS is getting blocked legitimately:

```bash
# Find Burak's IP
docker logs enms-nginx 2>&1 | grep "ovos" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq

# Edit nginx config (inside container)
docker exec -it enms-nginx bash
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/enms

# Add before rate limiting:
geo $limit_api {
    default 1;
    192.168.1.50 0;  # Burak's OVOS - no limit
}

map $limit_api $limit_key {
    0 "";
    1 $binary_remote_addr;
}

# Change existing line to use $limit_key:
limit_req_zone $limit_key zone=api_limit:10m rate=100r/m;

# Exit and reload
exit
docker exec enms-nginx nginx -s reload
```

### Fix 2: Block Attacking IP

If under DDoS attack:

```bash
# Find attacking IPs
docker logs enms-nginx 2>&1 | grep "429" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Block at firewall level
sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.45

# Or block in nginx (faster)
docker exec -it enms-nginx bash
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/enms

# Add at top of server block:
deny 203.0.113.45;
deny 198.51.100.0/24;  # Block entire subnet if needed

# Exit and reload
exit
docker exec enms-nginx nginx -s reload
```

### Fix 3: Restart Crashed Service

If analytics service crashed:

```bash
# Restart service
docker restart enms-analytics

# Wait 10 seconds
sleep 10

# Verify it's working
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health

# Check what caused crash
docker logs enms-analytics --tail 100 | grep -i "error\|fatal\|crash"
```

### Fix 4: Emergency Lockdown

If system is completely overwhelmed:

```bash
# Stop nginx (blocks all external traffic)
docker stop enms-nginx

# System is now isolated, only localhost access
# Investigate the issue:
docker logs enms-analytics --tail 500
./monitoring/check-system-health.sh

# When ready, restart
docker start enms-nginx
```

- ❌ No rate limiting
- ❌ No connection throttling  
- ❌ No attack detection
- ❌ System vulnerable to:
  - DDoS attacks
  - Resource exhaustion
  - Accidental overload from OVOS
  - Malicious bots

### After Protection (Risk: LOW ✅)
- ✅ Rate limiting: 100 req/min per IP (2 layers)
- ✅ Connection throttling: 10 concurrent per IP
- ✅ Real-time monitoring scripts
- ✅ 24/7 automated alerts
- ✅ Emergency response procedures
- ✅ System protected against:
  - DDoS attacks → Nginx blocks at 100 req/min
  - Resource exhaustion → Connection throttle limits load

## 📋 Daily Operations Checklist

### Morning Check (30 seconds)
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/enms
./monitoring/check-system-health.sh
```

**Look For:**
- ✅ All containers RUNNING
- ✅ Success rate > 95%
- ✅ No unusual endpoint patterns
- ✅ Low error count

### Weekly Review (5 minutes)
```bash
# Check last week's alerts
cat logs/alerts.log | grep "$(date -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d)" -A 1000

# Review request patterns
docker logs enms-nginx 2>&1 | grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" | wc -l

# Check resource trends
docker stats enms-analytics --no-stream
```

### Optional: Set Up Cron Jobs
```bash
crontab -e

# Add:
# Health check every hour
0 * * * * /home/ubuntu/enms/monitoring/check-system-health.sh >> /home/ubuntu/enms/logs/health-checks.log 2>&1

# Start auto-monitoring on reboot
@reboot nohup /home/ubuntu/enms/monitoring/auto-alert.sh > /home/ubuntu/enms/logs/monitor.log 2>&1 &
```

---

## 🔧 Fine-Tuning (Optional)

### Increase Rate Limit for OVOS

If OVOS needs more than 100 req/min:

```bash
# Edit application rate limiter
nano /home/ubuntu/enms/analytics/main.py

# Find: self.max_requests = 100
# Change to: self.max_requests = 200

# Restart
docker restart enms-analytics
```

### Decrease Rate Limit (If Under Attack)

```bash
# Edit nginx config
docker exec -it enms-nginx bash
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/enms

# Change: rate=100r/m
# To: rate=50r/m

# Reload
nginx -s reload
exit
```

## ✅ Verification Tests

### Test 1: Rate Limiting is Active
```bash
# Make 120 requests in quick succession
time for i in {1..120}; do curl -s -o /dev/null http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health; done

# Should take ~60 seconds (proves rate limiting)
# Without rate limiting, would take ~2-3 seconds
```

### Test 2: Connection Throttle is Active
```bash
# Check connection stats
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/stats/connections

# Should show:
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "data": {
#     "total_connections": 0-10,
#     "max_total": 100,
#     "connections_by_ip": {...}
#   }
# }
```

### Test 3: Monitoring Detects Issues
```bash
# Generate spike
for i in {1..50}; do curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health > /dev/null & done

# Check monitoring
./monitoring/monitor-request-rate.sh 10

# Should show spike in requests
```
