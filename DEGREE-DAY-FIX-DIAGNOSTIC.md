# Degree-Day Fix & EnPI Report Diagnostic
**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Degree-day calculation fixed, baselines retrained, reports regenerated

## Summary

Fixed the degree-day calculation in `feature_discovery.py` (changed from `SUM(GREATEST(...))` to `GREATEST(0, base - AVG(temp))` to avoid sample-frequency dependent overcounting). Restarted analytics service, retrained all 7 SEUs, and regenerated Jan-Sep 2025 monthly reports.

## Results After Fix

### ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY (Production-based SEUs)

- Jan-Sep 2025: Deviations range from +0.06% to +3.18%
- Model: R² = 0.9988, single feature (production_count)
- **Conclusion**: Proof that the pipeline works end-to-end when features are clean

**Hydraulic-Pump-1**: Average deviation **+6.87%**
- Jan-Sep 2025: Deviations range from +5.65% to +9.97%
- Model: R² = 0.9987, features: production_count + outdoor_temp_c

## Root Cause Analysis

### Degree-Day Calculation (FIXED ✅)

**Before Fix**:
```sql
SUM(GREATEST(0, 18 - outdoor_temp_c)) as heating_degree_days
```
- With hourly data (24 samples/day): produced ~312 degree-days/day
- Formula was summing degree-**hours**, not degree-days

**After Fix**:
```sql
GREATEST(0, 18 - AVG(outdoor_temp_c)) as heating_degree_days
```
- Correctly produces ~13 degree-days/day
- Matches ISO 50006 definition: HDD = Σ max(0, base_temp - T_daily_avg)

**Verification (Jan 2025)**:
| Day | Samples | Avg Temp | HDD (New) | HDD (Old) |
|-----|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-01-01 | 24 | 5.0°C | **13.0** | 312.1 |
| 2025-01-02 | 24 | 5.0°C | **13.0** | 312.4 |
| 2025-01-03 | 24 | 5.0°C | **13.0** | 312.0 |

Old formula was ~24× overcounting.

### HVAC Issue: Data Quality Problem (NOT Model Issue)

**Training Data (2024)**:
- Daily energy: ~300 kWh/day
- Degree-days: ~13 HDD/day (winter)
- Sample frequency: 24 samples/day (hourly)

**Actual Data (2025 Jan)**:
- Daily energy: ~**1,200 kWh/day** (4× higher!)
- Degree-days: ~13 HDD/day (same conditions)
- Sample frequency: 24 samples/day (hourly)

**Example Comparison**:
| Date | 2024 Energy | 2025 Energy | HDD | Ratio |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----|-------|
| Jan 1 | 302 kWh | 1,176 kWh | 13.0 | **3.9×** |
| Jan 2 | 323 kWh | 1,174 kWh | 13.0 | **3.6×** |
| Jan 3 | 319 kWh | 1,209 kWh | 13.0 | **3.8×** |

**Conclusion**: HVAC is genuinely consuming 3-4× more energy in 2025 vs 2024. This is **NOT** a model problem - this is real operational overconsumption or a data generation issue in the backfill/simulator.

**Possible Causes**:
1. Backfill script used different HVAC power generation formula than 2024 (check `scripts/backfill-2025-performance-period.py` vs `scripts/backfill-historical-data.py`)
2. HVAC efficiency degradation simulated incorrectly (EFFICIENCY_FACTOR not applied to HVAC)
3. Real operational issue (if this were production data)

### Compressor Issue: Negative Deviations (Under-prediction)

**Observation**: Compressor actual consumption is 15-30% LOWER than expected, despite:
- Same production levels (~190k units/day)
- Same outdoor temperature (~5°C winter, ~20°C summer)
- Same sample frequency (24 hourly samples)

**Example (Jan 2025)**:
| Day | Production | 2024 Energy | 2025 Energy | Expected | Actual | Deviation |
|-----|------------|-------------|-------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Jan 1 | 193,176 | 9,779 kWh | 11,282 kWh | - | - | - |
| Jan 2 | 191,376 | 9,758 kWh | 11,253 kWh | - | - | - |
| Jan 4 | 69,168 | 10,073 kWh | 4,080 kWh | - | - | - |

Wait - I see the problem! Days 4-5 have MUCH LOWER production (69k vs 193k), which the model correctly expects to reduce energy, but the reduction is even more than expected.

**Possible Issues**:
1. **Coefficient magnitude**: production_count coefficient is ~0.0073, which means each unit contributes ~0.007 kWh. For 190k units, that's 190,000 × 0.0073 = 1,387 kWh. But baseline shows expected ~8,100 kWh, so there's a ~6,700 kWh intercept component that doesn't scale with production.
2. **Units mismatch**: Production_count might be in different units in 2024 vs 2025 (e.g., per-hour vs per-shift vs cumulative).
3. **Efficiency factor**: The 2025 backfill applies 0.96-0.98 multiplier (2-4% efficiency gain), but the observed deviation is -20 to -30%, suggesting either:
   - The efficiency factor is being applied multiple times (compounding)
   - The 2024 data was intentionally inflated or 2025 was deflated beyond the efficiency factor

**Model Formula** (Compressor-1):
```
Energy (kWh) = 212.25 + 0.007287×production_count + 0.073494×outdoor_temp_c
```

For typical day (190k production, 5°C temp):
```
Expected = 212.25 + (0.007287 × 190,000) + (0.073494 × 5)
         = 212.25 + 1,384.53 + 0.37
         = 1,597.15 kWh/day  ← But model predicts ~8,100 kWh in reports!
```

**WAIT** - there's a huge discrepancy here. Let me check the actual feature aggregation...

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify production_count aggregation**:
   - Check if `energy_source_features` uses SUM for production_count ✅ (confirmed)
   - Verify daily production_count values match between training and prediction
   - Run diagnostic SQL to compare daily aggregates:
     ```sql
     -- Compare daily production aggregation
     SELECT 
       time_bucket('1 day', time)::date as day,
       SUM(production_count) as daily_production,
       AVG(production_count) as avg_production,
       COUNT(*) as samples
     FROM production_data
     WHERE machine_id = '<COMPRESSOR_ID>'
       AND time BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-10'
     GROUP BY day;
     ```

2. **Compare backfill scripts**:
   - Diff `scripts/backfill-historical-data.py` (2024) vs `scripts/backfill-2025-performance-period.py`
   - Check if HVAC power generation formula changed
   - Verify EFFICIENCY_FACTOR is applied consistently

3. **Check expected consumption calculation**:
   - Debug `seu_baseline_service.calculate_expected_consumption()`
   - Add logging to show feature values used for each day
   - Verify the formula application matches training

### Medium-Term Fixes

4. **For Compressor models**:
   - Check if production_count should be normalized (e.g., divide by 1000)
   - Consider using energy-per-unit (kWh/unit) as target instead of absolute kWh
   - Retrain with feature scaling if coefficients are too small

5. **For HVAC models**:
   - If 2025 data is correct, the model is working (detecting real overconsumption)
   - If 2025 data is wrong, fix backfill script and regenerate 2025 data
   - Consider adding operational hours or occupancy features

6. **Validation**:
   - Create scatter plots (actual vs expected) for each SEU
   - Calculate residuals and check for systematic bias
   - Verify CUSUM accumulation is correct

## Conclusion

**Degree-Day Fix**: ✅ Complete and verified  
**Conveyor-A Results**: ✅ Excellent (±3% deviations)  
**HVAC Results**: ⚠️ Model correct, but 2025 data shows 3-4× overconsumption (data quality issue)  
**Compressor Results**: ⚠️ Model under-predicting by 20-30% (investigate coefficient/aggregation)  

**Recommendation**: Focus on compressor production_count aggregation and backfill script comparison before presenting to Mr. Umut. The degree-day fix is correct, but the underlying data quality issues must be resolved to produce realistic ISO 50001 reports.
